# Complete List of Runtime Bugs Fixed

## ✅ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL BUGS - ALL FIXED

### Bug #20: Code Storage vs Access Pattern Mismatch - FIXED
**Severity**: CRITICAL - MCP tools would fail completely
**Problem**:
- Code was stored in S3 at `s3://artifacts-bucket/unzipped/{mission_id}/`
- Coordinator was passing S3 key `"unzipped/{mission_id}/"` to MCP tools
- MCP tools expected LOCAL filesystem paths, not S3 keys
- MCP servers were attempting S3 downloads themselves (wrong!)

**Fix Applied**:
- **Coordinator Agent**: Added `_download_code_from_s3()` method to download entire codebase to `/tmp/{mission_id}/` before spawning MCPs
- **All 5 MCP Servers**: Removed S3 download logic, now expect local paths only
- **Coordinator Agent**: Passes local filesystem path to MCP tools
- **Cleanup**: Added code cleanup in finally block to free `/tmp` space

### Bug #21: MCP Servers Storing Results to S3 - FIXED
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Architectural violation of MCP protocol
**Problem**:
- MCP servers were writing results to S3 and DynamoDB themselves
- This violates MCP protocol where tools return results via stdout (JSON-RPC)
- Created unnecessary IAM permissions for MCP servers
- Coordinator couldn't process results before storage

**Fix Applied**:
- **All 5 MCP Servers**: Removed `_store_results()` calls
- **All 5 MCP Servers**: Now return full results in JSON response
- **Coordinator Agent**: Already has logic to store results (no change needed)
- **Result**: Clean separation of concerns - MCPs scan, Coordinator stores

### Bug #22: Missing Security Tool Binaries in Coordinator Docker - FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Tools wouldn't execute
**Problem**:
- Coordinator Dockerfile installed MCP Python packages but not actual security tools
- semgrep, gitleaks, trivy binaries missing from container
- MCPs would spawn but tool execution would fail

**Fix Applied**:
- **Coordinator Dockerfile**: Added installation of semgrep, gitleaks, trivy binaries
- **Coordinator Dockerfile**: Added loop to install all MCP server Python requirements
- **Result**: All security tools available when MCPs spawn as subprocesses

### Bug #23: Coordinator Not Handling New MCP Response Format - FIXED
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Results would be lost
**Problem**:
- After removing `_store_results()` from MCPs, they now return raw `results` field
- Coordinator was still looking for `storage` field with S3 URIs (which no longer exists)
- Results would be lost because Coordinator wasn't storing them to S3
- DynamoDB entries would be incomplete or fail

**Fix Applied**:
- **Coordinator `_process_tool_results()`**: Changed to extract `raw_results` from MCP response instead of `storage`
- **Coordinator `_store_results()`**: Completely rewritten to:
  - Store each tool's raw results to S3 at `tool-results/{server}/{mission_id}/{timestamp}/results.json`
  - Compute SHA256 digest for evidence chain
  - Store metadata to DynamoDB with S3 URI for Synthesizer consumption
  - Handle failures by storing error metadata to DynamoDB
- **Result**: Complete data flow from MCP → Coordinator → S3/DynamoDB → Synthesizer

### Bug #24: Synthesizer Crash on Failed Tool Results - FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Agent would crash when any tool failed
**Problem**:
- Coordinator stores failed tools with empty S3 URIs and status='failed'
- Synthesizer tried to parse empty S3 URI: `bucket, key = ''.split('/', 1)` → crash
- No error handling around S3 reads
- Failed tools would cause entire Synthesizer agent to fail

**Fix Applied**:
- **Synthesizer `_read_tool_results()`**: Check status field, skip if 'failed' or empty S3 URI
- **Synthesizer `_read_tool_results()`**: Added try/except around S3 read operations
- **Synthesizer `_read_tool_results()`**: Log warnings for skipped results, continue processing
- **Result**: Synthesizer gracefully handles partial tool failures, processes successful results

### Bug #25: Obsolete MCP Task Failure Alarm - FIXED
**Severity**: LOW - Misleading monitoring
**Problem**:
- CloudWatch alarm named "Hivemind-MCP-Task-Failures" implied MCPs run as separate ECS tasks
- MCPs actually run as subprocesses within Coordinator agent container
- Alarm would never trigger for actual MCP failures (those are internal to Coordinator)
- Misleading alarm name and description

**Fix Applied**:
- **Orchestration Stack**: Renamed alarm to "Hivemind-Agent-Task-Failures"
- **Orchestration Stack**: Updated description to reflect agent task failures, not MCP task failures
- **Comment**: Added clarification that MCPs run as subprocesses, not separate tasks
- **Result**: Accurate monitoring of actual ECS task failures (agent containers)

### Bug #26: Missing MCP Environment Variables - FIXED
**Severity**: CRITICAL - MCPs would fail to initialize
**Problem**:
- MCP client (`src/shared/mcp_client/client.py`) reads `MCP_SERVERS_PATH` environment variable
- Default: `os.environ.get('MCP_SERVERS_PATH', '/app/src/mcp_servers')`
- Environment variable never set in agent container definitions
- MCP client would default to `/app/src/mcp_servers` (correct by accident!)
- `ENABLE_MCP_TOOLS` flag also never explicitly set
- Relying on defaults is fragile and could break if code changes

**Fix Applied**:
- **Compute Stack**: Added `MCP_SERVERS_PATH: '/app/src/mcp_servers'` to all agent containers
- **Compute Stack**: Added `ENABLE_MCP_TOOLS: 'true'` to all agent containers
- **Result**: Explicit configuration, no reliance on code defaults

### Bug #27: Archaeologist Agent Memory Leak - FIXED
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Container would run out of disk space
**Problem**:
- Archaeologist downloads entire codebase to `/tmp/{mission_id}/`
- After analysis completes, downloaded code is never deleted
- Multiple missions would fill up `/tmp` in ECS container
- Could cause disk space issues or subsequent mission failures

**Fix Applied**:
- **Archaeologist Agent**: Added finally block to clean up downloaded code
- **Archaeologist Agent**: Uses `shutil.rmtree()` to remove entire directory tree
- **Archaeologist Agent**: Logs cleanup success/failure for debugging
- **Result**: Clean `/tmp` after each mission, no disk space leaks

### Bug #28: Missing scan_type in ContextManifest - FIXED
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Tool selection would fail
**Problem**:
- Strategist agent reads `scan_type` from ContextManifest to decide tool selection
- ContextManifest dataclass didn't include `scan_type` field
- Archaeologist didn't populate `scan_type` in manifest
- Strategist would get KeyError or default to wrong tools
- AWS scans would incorrectly select code scanning tools

**Fix Applied**:
- **ContextManifest**: Added `scan_type: str` field as second parameter
- **Archaeologist**: Read `SCAN_TYPE` from environment in `__init__`
- **Archaeologist**: Pass `scan_type` when creating manifest
- **Orchestration Stack**: Added `SCAN_TYPE` to containerOverrides (from Step Functions state)
- **Result**: Strategist correctly selects AWS vs code scanning tools

19. **Missing Agent Requirements** - FIXED (all 6 agents)

## Additional Access Bugs - NOT FIXED ⚠️

### 20. No ECS Task Execution Role for ECR
**Problem**: ECS tasks can't pull images from ECR
**Fix Needed**: Ensure execution roles have ECR permissions

### 21. MCP Servers Can't Write Results
**Problem**: MCP servers write scan results but have no S3 write permissions
**Fix Needed**: Grant MCP server role S3 write to artifacts bucket

### 22. Agents Download Code Pattern Undefined
**Problem**: No code exists to download S3 files to local /tmp for processing
**Fix Needed**: Add S3 download logic in agents before spawning MCPs

### 23. ECS Task Volumes Not Configured  
**Problem**: No shared volume between agent task and MCP processes
**Fix Needed**: Configure ECS task definition volumes for code sharing

### 24. MCP Process Spawning Unclear
**Problem**: How do agents spawn MCP as child processes? stdio communication requires local process
**Fix Needed**: Clarify if MCPs are subprocesses or separate ECS tasks

## Critical Design Questions

1. **Where does code actually run?**
   - Is code downloaded to agent container `/tmp`?
   - Is code mounted via EFS?
   - Do MCPs run as subprocesses or ECS tasks?

2. **How do MCPs access code?**
   - If subprocesses: need shared `/tmp` in same container
   - If ECS tasks: need EFS or S3 direct access

3. **How do MCPs return results?**
   - Write to S3 directly (need credentials)?
   - Return via stdio to parent agent?
   - Write to shared volume?

## Recommended Architecture Fix

### Option A: Subprocess Model (Simplest)
1. MCPs installed in agent Docker image
2. Agent downloads code from S3 to `/tmp/{mission_id}/`
3. Agent spawns MCP as subprocess, passes local path
4. MCP writes results to stdout (stdio protocol)
5. Agent captures stdout, writes to S3/DynamoDB

### Option B: Shared EFS Model (More Complex)
1. Create EFS filesystem
2. Mount EFS to `/mnt/code` in all agent/MCP tasks
3. Agent downloads S3 code to EFS
4. Spawn MCP as subprocess, reference EFS path
5. Results flow same as Option A

## Next Steps Required

1. Clarify architecture: subprocess vs ECS task model for MCPs
2. Implement code download logic in agents
3. Test end-to-end: S3 → Agent → MCP → Results
4. Add EFS if needed for multi-task access
5. Verify all permissions chains work

## 🆕 NEWLY DISCOVERED BUGS (Iteration 5)

### Bug #29: AWS Scan Path - Strategist Reading Non-Existent Archaeologist Output - **NOT YET FIXED**
**Severity**: CRITICAL - AWS scans will completely fail
**Problem**:
- **Orchestration Flow for AWS Scans**: Unpack → Strategist → Coordinator → Synthesis → Archivist
- **Orchestration Flow for Code Scans**: Unpack → (Archaeologist + Strategist in parallel) → Coordinator → Synthesis → Archivist
- **Archaeologist only runs for Code scans** (correct by design - it analyzes codebase structure)
- **But Strategist agent code is the SAME for both paths**
- **Line 62 in `src/agents/strategist/agent.py`**: `context = self._read_context_manifest()`
- **Line 85**: `key = f"agent-outputs/archaeologist/{self.mission_id}/context-manifest.json"`
- **For AWS scans**: Archaeologist never ran, so this S3 key doesn't exist
- **Result**: Strategist will crash with `NoSuchKey` error on AWS scan path

**Root Cause**:
- Strategist assumes ContextManifest always exists from Archaeologist
- This is only true for Code scans, not AWS scans
- Strategist needs conditional logic based on scan_type

**Impact**:
- **ALL AWS scans will fail** at Strategist step
- State machine will trigger error handler
- No AWS security scanning possible

**Fix Needed**:
```python
# src/agents/strategist/agent.py
def run(self) -> ExecutionStrategy:
    scan_type = os.environ.get('SCAN_TYPE', 'code')
    
    if scan_type == 'aws':
        # AWS scans don't have Archaeologist context
        context = self._create_aws_context()
    else:
        # Code scans have Archaeologist context manifest
        context = self._read_context_manifest()
    
    # Continue with planning...

def _create_aws_context(self) -> Dict:
    """Create minimal context for AWS scans without Archaeologist."""
    return {
        'scan_type': 'aws',
        'mission_id': self.mission_id,
        'service_name': os.environ.get('REPO_NAME', 'aws-infrastructure'),
        'criticality_tier': 1,  # Default to high for AWS
        'aws_account_id': os.environ.get('AWS_ACCOUNT_ID', ''),
        'aws_region': os.environ.get('AWS_REGION', 'us-east-1')
    }
```

### Bug #30: Archivist Attempting to Load Context Manifest for AWS Scans - **NOT YET FIXED**
**Severity**: HIGH - May cause failures in final archival step
**Problem**:
- **Line 53 in `src/agents/archivist/agent.py`**: `context_manifest = self._load_context_manifest()`
- If `_load_context_manifest()` reads from Archaeologist output (needs verification)
- Will fail for AWS scans where Archaeologist never ran
- Would cause Archivist to fail at final step after all analysis completed

**Need to Verify**:
- Check what `_load_context_manifest()` actually does
- If it reads from Archaeologist S3 output → Bug confirmed
- If it reads from DynamoDB or elsewhere → May be OK

**Potential Fix** (if bug confirmed):
```python
# src/agents/archivist/agent.py
def _load_context_manifest(self) -> Optional[Dict]:
    scan_type = os.environ.get('SCAN_TYPE', 'code')
    
    if scan_type == 'code':
        # Load from Archaeologist output
        return self._read_archaeologist_context()
    else:
        # AWS scans don't have Archaeologist context
        # Return minimal context or None
        return {
            'scan_type': 'aws',
            'service_name': os.environ.get('REPO_NAME', 'aws-infrastructure')
        }
```

## 🔴 CRITICAL DATA FLOW BUGS (Iteration 6)

### Bug #31: Synthesizer/Critic Race Condition - Parallel Execution with Data Dependency ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Negotiation mechanism completely broken
**Problem**:
- **Lines 133-138 in [`orchestration-stack.ts`](infrastructure/stacks/orchestration-stack.ts:133)**: Synthesizer and Critic run in PARALLEL via `sfn.Parallel`
- **Line 48 in [`critic/agent.py`](src/agents/critic/agent.py:48)**: Critic's `_read_proposals()` reads from Redis key `negotiation:{mission_id}:proposals`
- **Line 184 in [`synthesizer/agent.py`](src/agents/synthesizer/agent.py:184)**: Synthesizer writes proposals to same Redis key
- **Race Condition**: Both agents START SIMULTANEOUSLY
  - Critic immediately calls `_read_proposals()` at startup
  - Synthesizer hasn't written proposals yet (still analyzing tool results)
  - Critic reads EMPTY LIST from Redis
  - Critic has nothing to review, completes immediately
  - Negotiation mechanism is completely bypassed

**Data Dependency Chain**:
```
Synthesizer: Read tool results → Synthesize findings → Write to Redis → Complete
Critic:      Read from Redis (DEPENDS ON Synthesizer output) → Review → Write counterproposals → Complete
```

**Current Behavior**:
1. Step Functions launches BOTH agents simultaneously in parallel
2. Critic starts, calls `_read_proposals()` immediately → gets `[]` (empty)
3. Critic processes empty list → no reviews generated
4. Synthesizer (running concurrently) eventually writes proposals
5. But Critic already finished with no work done!
6. Archivist reads consensus, but Critic never reviewed anything

**Impact**: 
- No quality control on findings
- False positives not challenged
- Severity misclassifications not corrected
- Entire adversarial negotiation design pattern is non-functional

**Root Cause**: 
Architectural mismatch between:
- Design intent: Iterative negotiation (Synthesizer proposes → Critic challenges → Consensus)
- Actual implementation: Parallel execution (both start together)

**Fix Needed**:
Change parallel execution to SEQUENTIAL:

```typescript
// infrastructure/stacks/orchestration-stack.ts
// REMOVE parallel execution
// const synthesisCrucible = new sfn.Parallel(...)

// REPLACE with sequential chain
mergeBranches
  .next(synthesizerTask)     // Run Synthesizer FIRST
  .next(criticTask)          // THEN run Critic (can read proposals)
  .next(waitForConsensus)    // Then wait for any async negotiation
  .next(archivistTask)
  .next(notifyCompletion);
```

This ensures:
1. Synthesizer completes and writes all proposals to Redis
2. THEN Critic starts and can read the proposals
3. Proper adversarial review happens
4. Consensus is meaningful


### Bug #32: Missing Redis Connection Error Handling in 4 Agents - ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Agents crash with cryptic errors on Redis unavailability
**Problem**:
- **Strategist, Synthesizer, Critic, Archivist**: No try/except around `redis.Redis()` connection
- **Line 49 in strategist/agent.py**, **Line 45 in synthesizer/agent.py**, **Line 25 in critic/agent.py**, **Line 40 in archivist/agent.py**
- If Redis connection fails (network issue, ElastiCache warming up, etc.):
  - Agent crashes during `__init__` with connection error
  - No graceful fallback
  - No retry logic
- **Coordinator and Archaeologist** handle this correctly with try/except and self.redis_client = None

**Inconsistency**:
- Some agents (Coordinator, Archaeologist) handle Redis failures gracefully
- Others (Strategist, Synthesizer, Critic, Archivist) crash immediately
- No consistent error handling pattern

**Impact**:
- Transient network issues cause complete mission failure
- ElastiCache cold starts cause crashes
- Difficult to debug (generic connection errors)

**Fix Needed**:
Add connection retry logic with exponential backoff for agents that REQUIRE Redis:

```python
# src/agents/synthesizer/agent.py, critic/agent.py, archivist/agent.py
def _connect_redis_with_retry(self, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            client = redis.Redis(
                host=self.redis_endpoint,
                port=self.redis_port,
                decode_responses=True,
                socket_connect_timeout=5,
                socket_timeout=5,
                retry_on_timeout=True
            )
            client.ping()
            return client
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt
                logger.warning(f"Redis connection failed (attempt {attempt+1}/{max_retries}): {e}. Retrying in {wait_time}s...")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            else:
                logger.error(f"Redis connection failed after {max_retries} attempts")
                raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to connect to Redis at {self.redis_endpoint}:{self.redis_port}") from e

self.redis_client = self._connect_redis_with_retry()
```

## 🆕 JSON PARSING BUGS (Iteration 7) - Error Handling Missing

### Bug #33: Missing JSON Error Handling in Critic Agent - ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Agent crashes on malformed JSON
**Problem**:
- **Line 77**: `return [json.loads(p) for p in proposals if p]` - No try/except
- **Line 125**: `review = json.loads(response.content)` - No try/except for Claude response
